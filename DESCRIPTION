Description: TransCox-Sparse is an enhanced version of the TransCox package, designed for high-dimensional sparse survival analysis. It uses transfer learning to improve Cox regression model performance on a target (primary) domain by leveraging source (auxiliary) domain data, especially suitable for feature selection and sparse modeling in high-dimensional settings (p >> n).
